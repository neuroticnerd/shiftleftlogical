This is a catalog of information, resources, and pseudo-articles I've written
which I hope will be helpful to others undertaking a journey in computer
science and/or software development. It is not comprehensive, nor does it
attempt to be, it is simply a compilation of information and resources which
were useful to me or that I feel may be useful to others in their search for
knowledge. This information can be somewhat opinionated in
certain areas, but tries to maintain an overall agnostic approach.
