Why Learn Python?
=================

Why you should learn Python: (hereâ€™s why: http://www.skilledup.com/articles/reasons-to-learn-python/)

*   very human-readable syntax
    the clean and concise syntax makes it very easy to understand and to start
    learning, as well as being much less intimidating than something like
    C/C++ or Java which include many special characters

*   automatic memory management
    while memory management is something that is important to learn, not
    having to worry about allocating and deallocating memory at first can
    allow one to focus on the initial core programming concepts

*   highly expressive semantics
    writing less code means rapid prototyping and higher efficiency where
    something that may take a day to write in Python could potentially take a
    week or more in C/C++ or Java

*   multi-paradigm language
    can be used as an object oriented language, an imperative language, or
    even a functional language

*   loads of flexibility in applications
    executables can be easily created for scripting, C code can be easily
    linked into python interfaces, or python can even be easily embedded
    within certain languages like C/C++

*   interactive command line is good for experimenting and debugging

*   strongly typed language, but offers the flexibility of dynamic typing

*   highly extensive standard and third-party libraries are very easily
    accessible; most often there is a library that already does what you need,
    without reinventing the wheel

*   well-documented and well-established community

*   includes many complex data types as built-in standards

*   tons of great resources and tutorials are available

*   completely free to use
