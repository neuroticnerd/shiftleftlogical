C/C++ References

|link_learnc|
    This is a great place to start learning C without worrying about compilers
    or settings up a dev environment at first, just get your feet wet.

|link_cbook|
    The C Book; amazing online free book for learning the C language. It’s a
    little harder to digest than some newer tutorials, but it’s well-written
    and covers what you need to know; this is what I used when learning to
    program initially.

|link_cppsite|
    Certainly not the most stylish website, but an excellent C++ reference site
    with forum and tutorial sections as well, I’ve been using it for years.

|link_cstandard|
    A tad dry perhaps, but really rather comprehensive; probably better as a
    reference or deeper look into the language, not likely the best place to
    initially learn from.

|link_matterscomp|
    A rather interesting look at quite a few different algorithms and
    computational problems with ideas and example code solutions.

|link_cppannotations| (|link_cppanncontent|)
    Somewhat dry, and not entirely Windows-friendly as it has a decently-sized
    section on forking processes (which isn’t really usually supported by
    non-unix systems), but good content that seems to be kept up-to-date.

|link_cnetcode|
    Network programming, especially in a lower-level language can be a real
    pain, and quite frankly... frustrating. This can help ease some of the
    cognitive burden and trial and error for doing that in C/C++.

You should also be aware of the |link_cbookguide|, however, just keep in mind that resources listed there are usually books that require purchase.
