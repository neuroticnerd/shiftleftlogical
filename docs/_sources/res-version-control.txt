Version Control
===============

There are a number of options for version control, even a good number that are
free to use or open source. My choice is always Git, but to each their own.
The learning curve may be slightly steeper, but it serves its purpose well.

|link_git|
    Git is a distributed version control system and though it can take a
    bit of getting used to, it is extremely powerful for any size project; Git
    is a commandline tool by itself, but there are third party GUI’s for it,
    and hosting providers for repositories.

|link_github|
    GitHub is a web-based front-end and hosting platform for
    Git repositories, and while a free account will not let you create private
    repositories, its still an amazing tool to know how to use, and I would
    even go so far as saying its worth a paid account once you start doing
    more serious programming projects (plus its a good cheap way to host all
    your code in the cloud so you can always access it)

|link_gitextensions|
    If you happen to be struck with the misfortune of
    needing to use Windows for development, then look no further for a good
    Git GUI for the Windows OS

|link_sourcetree|
    Possibly the best git GUI for Mac and Windows; they
    want you to ‘register’ your copy but its free to do so (just give them a
    spam email address or something)

|link_gitgui_nix|
    Here is one of the available lists of GUIs for Git;
    while most things I write are designed to run on Unix machines, I usually
    develop on Mac or Windows (when under duress)

|link_smartgit|
    I have not personally tested it yet, but have heard some
    very promising anecdotes and supposedly it is free for non-commercial use

|link_gitlab|
    This is an alternative to GitHub hosting with the option
    to download the source-code for free and self-host your git repositories;
    I’ve not spent too much time with it yet, and still prefer GitHub for the
    moment, but it has a lot going for it and continues to grow
