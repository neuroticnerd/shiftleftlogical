Computer Science
================

Fundamentals
------------

|link_wiki_compsci|
    Gives an overview of topics and areas of interest
    related to the field of computer science; obviously not in-depth content,
    but it's still good to have a broad understanding of what computer science
    actually encompasses as a field

|link_compsci_intro|
    University lectures aren't always the easiest things
    to digest, but this is a very solid introduction to many of the fundamental
    concepts and ideas of computer science

|link_compsci_basics|
    This provides a very basic overview of computer
    architecture, what the system components are, and their function


Discrete Mathematics
--------------------

|link_mathforcompsci|
    This seems to be a fairly comprehensive delve into
    discrete math, although it appears to potentially be missing some topics
    in boolean logic and combinatorics
