Developer's Toolbox
===================

There are many tools that might be specific to the project or language(s) you
are working with, but there are a few which are generally useful regardless
of the environment.


|link_putty|
    Easily the best SSH client if you need to work with Windows
    (UNIX systems should already have the tools you need installed); when you
    install putty, it should also give you the executables for puttygen which
    you use to generate your encryption keys, and pageant, which is a key agent.

|link_openvpn|
    It takes a little research to learn how to configure it
    properly, but using a VPN can be extremely useful and solve a ton of
    problems that would otherwise require complex SSH tunneling (which can be
    a real pain), and OpenVPN is my favorite, its reliable, safe (with the
    right encryption settings), free, and open source.

|link_sublime3|
    An excellent text editor -- for developing fully native
    applications or GUI’s you might want a full IDE -- for everything else
    you'll be hard-pressed to find anything better than Sublime; it’s been my
    favorite for a long time now.

|link_ff_addons|
    Yeah yeah yeah, I know you know about firefox, but
    (IMO) its the best browser, partly due to the add-ons ecosystem; while I
    have a ton of add-ons installed, there are only a couple I really couldn’t
    live without: NoScript (I’m OCD, I don’t like sites I visit running a
    bunch of js I don’t know about), and most importantly Firebug. Firebug was
    a web developer’s dream come true, it has everything you need to make
    client-side web development a whole lot easier.
