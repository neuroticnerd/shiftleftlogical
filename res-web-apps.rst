Web Development
===============


Things to Note
--------------

*   Web development is a very very broad spectrum of tools and languages; this
    archive does not (and cannot) attempt to cover all of the available options
    and possible technologies

*   Always put CSS and Javascript into separate files and link them into the
    HTML, do not clutter your HTML with scripts and styling


Resources
---------

|link_w3fools|
    ``!important;`` please read this site before doing any web
    dev research, it shows you all the reasons you should NOT use a commonly
    appearing site called W3Schools. Also note that W3Schools is not in any
    way affiliated with the similarly named |link_w3c|, which is an
    organization that creates international standards for a number of
    web technologies!

|link_html5rocks|
    Easily one of THE best places to go for HTML 5 information; all sorts of tutorials and information about the HTML5 specification.

|link_mozdev|
    Another really great resource for all sorts of information
    regarding HTML, CSS, and JS, as well as web API’s and DOM.

|link_css3|
    One of, if not the best place for CSS3 information aside
    from the mozilla developer network.

|link_xml_wiki| (|link_xml_tutorial|)/|link_json_wiki| (|link_json_tutorial|)
    Both are very common data exchange formats for web technologies, and
    while XML has much more complex uses, the basics of both are very simple
    and easy to understand (personally I greatly prefer JSON since you seldom
    encounter the same parsing shenanigans as is required with XML).

|link_django_tut|
    My favorite back-end Python web framework for web apps, it has
    ease-of-use, a great MVC architecture, and the full power of Python.

|link_learnjs|
    Excellent tutorial to learn the core of creating a
    dynamic client-side experience.

|link_jquery|
    jQuery is in many ways the de-facto standard as far as js libraries are
    concerned, you’d be hard pressed to find a modern website that doesn’t make
    use of this awesome js framework.

|link_bootstrap|
    Twitter’s own front-end bootstrap framework is one of the most
    popular for good reason; once you learn how to leverage it, it can make
    prototyping and scaffolding very fast.

|link_lessc|
    LESS is a CSS preprocessor that expands the powers of CSS
    immensely and removes some annoying limitations of CSS by itself.
