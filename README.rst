Shift Left Logical
==================

This is a curated index of free resources which I hope will be helpful to
others undertaking a journey in computer science and/or software development.
It is not comprehensive, nor does it attempt to be, it is simply a compilation
of resources which were useful to me or that I feel will be useful to others
in their search for knowledge. This information can be somewhat opinionated in
certain areas, but tries to maintain an overall agnostic approach.
