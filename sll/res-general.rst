General Resources
=================

Aside from making sure you don't neglect the official documentation of the
languages and tools you are using for a
project, don't forget that Google/<insert-favorite-search-engine> is your best
friend! Many languages, libraries, or frameworks also have their own respective
forums and/or IRC channels where more knowledgeable people can answer questions
you might come across.


Forums and Blogs
----------------

|link_stackoverflow|
    One of the most popular software and tech forums, and for good reason;
    easily the best forum I’ve found for anything programming related,
    regardless of language -- the ‘accepted’ answers are not always the best,
    or easiest approach, so you may have to use a little intuition and look at
    some of the other answers listed for questions, but I can’t count the
    number of times a great answer has helped me from that site.

|link_codinghorror|
    The blog of Jeff Atwood who, among other things, Co-Founded
    |link_stackoverflow|, it is a good source for insight and software related
    tidbits from an industry veteran.

|link_joelonsoftware|
    Joel Spolsky is another blogger as well as being the other Co-Founder of
    |link_stackoverflow|. He also has good things to read.

|link_codingintro|
    This resource used to be available |link_introold| (at time of writing this
    link no longer works).
    Now it seems to only be available via the Wayback Machine, but it is a
    very simple intro to programming from the assumption that the reader
    doesn't know anything about it.
