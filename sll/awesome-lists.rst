The Awesome Lists
====================

The |link_awesome| on GitHub.

I'm not entirely sure how they started or where it began, but these lists
have been around for a while now on GitHub. If you want to know about
REST API frameworks in Python, or what free/OSS people are using for
self-hosting a variety of things... well, chances are you can find it in these
lists. The main list above acts as an index to all of the other more specific
lists or individual resources.

These lists can be a fantastic way to find resources, references, or software
related to a topic you are interested in or are learning. There is even an
|link_awesome_search|
that someone made to help locate what you're looking for in the lists.

Some of the lists I have found useful in particular are:

*   |link_awesome_python|
*   |link_awesome_c|
*   |link_awesome_cpp|
*   |link_awesome_go|
*   |link_awesome_raspi|
*   |link_awesome_selfhosted|
